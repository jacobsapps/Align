# Align

Align gives you an easy way to align views in SwiftUI. 

Simply `import Align` in whichever SwiftUI view you like and you're good to go. Align supplies the simple `align` ViewModifier which you can add to any view.

The way it works is by creating spacers in a VStack / HStack around your view to position it how you like.

This library is super simple - check out Sources/Align/Align for the code and to see SwiftUI previews for each alignment. I would honestly recommend just copy-pasting the source code into your own project to avoid littering your code with `import Align`, as I'm probably not going to need to update this unless there are some interesting new SwiftUI APIs to extend it with. But if you do copy this, I'd really appreciate a star on Github!
